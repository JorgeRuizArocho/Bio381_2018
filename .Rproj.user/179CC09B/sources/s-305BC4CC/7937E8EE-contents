Fig 1. The domestication of crops has an direct effect over the morphological traits of plant wild progenitors. Therefore, we are expecting that this changes will alters arthropod biodiversity that are naturally associated with wild species and subsequently the plant-insect interactions within wild and cultivated crops will be different. At the same time, the proccess of domestication has added abiotic variables (such as pesticides, fungicides, tillages, etc.) that will indirecly affect arthropod biodiversity and insect interactions. We aim to understand how the origins of agriculture have shaped insect agrobiodiversity in the Mesoamerican center of crop origin, a region that has contributed many important crops that feed the world.
